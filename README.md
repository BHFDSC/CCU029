# Child hospital admission with COVID-19 – risk factors, risk groups and NHS care utilisation

## Project description

During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many deaths and admissions to hospital among adults with COVID-19. There were much lower risks of these adverse health outcomes in children. Nonetheless, a subset of children with severe COVID-19 are admitted to hospital, require intensive care and experience longer-term health issues. Our research will help us understand more about which children are at risk of severe disease and whether the risk of hospitalisation has changed over time with emergence of the delta strain of the COVID-19 virus.

In children under 18 years old, we will explore factors, which may affect the risk of needing hospital admission or of dying with COVID-19, including age, pre-existing diseases, obesity, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation. We will also use the fact that the dominant type (or ‘variant’) of COVID-19 disease has changed to different ones in specific and known time periods, to explore whether or not the current delta strain is more severe for children. Then we will use the data to explore the risks versus benefit of child vaccination in those under the age of 12 years, and explore how many child hospital beds might be needed, over the next phase of the epidemic in England. 

Better understanding of risk factors for hospitalisation and death among children with COVID-19 will help to inform child health policy, for example, policies on vaccination in children or remote learning provision to reduce risk for vulnerable groups. The exploration of the impact of the delta variant in causing severe COVID-19 disease in children is important in planning services in the approaching winter months when the NHS will be under strain.
